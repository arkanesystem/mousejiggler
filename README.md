The free program "Mouse Jiggler" automatically moves your mouse pointer a little bit every few seconds. So you can prevent the screensaver from turning on or your computer from going into sleep mode. The freeware pretends a user interaction to the system - by default it is a minimal mouse movement every second. You can also increase this interval in the options. There you will also find a so-called "Zen mode". It ensures that the mouse movements of the "Mouse Jiggler" run virtually in one place, so that you yourself do not notice anything about it.
